      <strong>1. Post-Impressionism</strong> <br /><br/>
      Post-Impressionism is an art movement that developed in the 1890s. It is
      characterized by a subjective approach to painting, as artists opted to
      evoke emotion rather than realism in their work. While their styles,
      therefore, wildly varied, paintings completed in the Post-Impressionist
      manner share some similar qualities. These include symbolic motifs,
      unnatural color, and painterly brushstrokes.

      <strong>2. Cubism</strong> <br /><br/>
      Cubism is an art movement that made its debut in 1907. Pioneered by Pablo
      Picasso and Georges Braque, the style is characterized by fragmented
      subject matter deconstructed in such a way that it can be viewed from
      multiple angles simultaneously.

      <strong>3. Constructivism</strong> <br /><br/>
      Constructivism was an artistic and architectural philosophy that
      originated in Russia beginning in 1915 by Vladimir Tatlin and Alexander
      Rodchenko. Abstract and austere, constructivist art aimed to reflect
      modern industrial society and urban space. The movement rejected
      decorative stylization in favor of the industrial assemblage of materials.
      Constructivists were in favour of art for propaganda and social purposes,
      and were associated with Soviet socialism, the Bolsheviks and the Russian
      avant-garde.

      <strong>4. Futurism</strong> <br /><br/>
      Fascinated by new industry and thrilled by what laid ahead, the early
      20th-century Futurists carved out a place in history. Growing out of
      Italy, these artists worked as painters, sculptors, graphic designers,
      musicians, architects, and industrial designers. Together, they helped
      shape a new, modern style of art that still has staying power today.

      <strong>5. Vorticism</strong> <br /><br />
      Vorticism was a London-based modernist art movement formed in 1914 by the
      writer and artist Wyndham Lewis. The movement was partially inspired by
      Cubism and was introduced to the public by means of the publication of the
      Vorticist manifesto in Blast magazine. Familiar forms of representational
      art were rejected in favour of a geometric style that tended towards a
      hard-edged abstraction.

      <strong>6. Suprematism</strong> <br /><br />
      Suprematism is an art movement focused on basic geometric forms, such as
      circles, squares, lines, and rectangles, painted in a limited range of
      colors. It was founded by Kazimir Malevich in Russia, and announced in
      Malevich's 1915 Last Futurist Exhibition of Paintings 0,10, in St.
      Petersburg, where he, alongside 13 other artists, exhibited 36 works in a
      similar style. The term suprematism refers to an abstract art based upon
      "the supremacy of pure artistic feeling" rather than on visual depiction
      of objects.

      <strong>7. Fauvism</strong> <br /><br />
      Fauvism is a movement co-founded by French artists Henri Matisse and André
      Derain. The style of les Fauves, or “the wild beasts,” is characterized by
      a saturated color palette, thick brushstrokes, and simplified—often nearly
      abstracted—forms. The movement flourished in Paris and other parts of
      France from 1905 until 1910.

      <strong>8. De Stijl</strong> <br /><br />
      De Stijl also known as Neoplasticism, was a Dutch art movement founded in
      1917 in Leiden. De Stijl consisted of artists and architects. In a more
      narrow sense, the term De Stijl is used to refer to a body of work from
      1917 to 1931 founded in the Netherlands. Proponents of De Stijl advocated
      pure abstraction and universality by a reduction to the essentials of form
      and colour; they simplified visual compositions to vertical and
      horizontal, using only black, white and primary colors.

      <strong>9. Dada</strong> <br /><br />
      Dada (/ˈdɑːdɑː/) or Dadaism was an art movement of the European
      avant-garde in the early 20th century, with early centres in Zürich,
      Switzerland, at the Cabaret Voltaire (c. 1916). New York Dada began c.
      1915, and after 1920 Dada flourished in Paris. Dadaist activities lasted
      until c. the mid 1920s.

      <strong>10. Surrealism</strong> <br /><br />
      Surrealism was a cultural movement which developed in Europe in the
      aftermath of World War I and was largely influenced by Dada. The movement
      is best known for its visual artworks and writings and the juxtaposition
      of distant realities to activate the unconscious mind through the imagery.
      Artists painted unnerving, illogical scenes, sometimes with photographic
      precision, creating strange creatures from everyday objects, and
      developing painting techniques that allowed the unconscious to express
      itself. Its aim was, according to leader André Breton, to "resolve the
      previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute
      reality, a super-reality", or surreality.
